Following the successful launch of our official iOS app, in January we've begun the development of an Android version. We continue working with the NYC design agency [Lickability](https://lickability.com/) and welcome [Gregory Klyushnikov](https://grishka.me/), better known as grishka on the fediverse, as the lead Android developer. Gregory is a talented developer with a history of working on social apps like VKontakte and Telegram.

Continued development is not limited to Android. Work on the app flows into the main Mastodon software as existing APIs are adjusted and new APIs are added to support new features, and the web app's UI is improved with ideas from the professional UX designers working on the iOS and Android apps.

We are excited to bring an app that takes usability, new user onboarding and visual design seriously to one of the largest mobile platforms.

The efforts are sponsored by our generous sponsors on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/mastodon) and our [custom sponsorship platform](https://sponsor.joinmastodon.org), and by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research through the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/project/mastodon-mobile-apps-und-e2e-verschluesselung/) (BMBF FÃ¶rderkennzeichen: 01IS21S29). **Thanks to everyone who is already sponsoring Mastodon, and stay tuned for updates!**
