The most recent update of [Mastodon for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.joinmastodon.android) introduces a highly anticipated feature--lists. With the new update, you now have the ability to create custom lists and categorize your follows based on specific topics or interests, while removing them from your home feed.

This not only helps in decluttering your home feed but also allows you to engage with certain topics on your own terms, when you are ready. Additionally, we reworked the home tab to provide easy navigation between your home feed, lists, and followed hashtags, so you can get the most out of your experience on Mastodon.

We've got more updates in the pipeline as we aim to make Mastodon the most beautiful and delightful social media app on Android. Our iOS and web teams are also working steadily on new features and improvements, so stay tuned!
