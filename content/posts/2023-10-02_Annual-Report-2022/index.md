Some of your were asking for it, some of you had no idea it was coming. The 2022 Annual Report is ready! As a non-profit organization supported exclusively by donations, we like to keep our community updated on our yearly progress, and 2022 was an interesting year to say the least. Keep in mind though that we're already more than halfway through 2023, and a lot of things have evolved and changed since then! You'll be able to read about that in the 2023 report, which, fingers crossed, you won't have to wait half a year for.
