The new Mastodon release brings you a much better audio player and improved support for different audio and video formats, as well as some additional security mechanisms.<!-- more -->

The **audio player has been completely reworked** to have a more eye-catching design. It will extract album art from the uploaded audio file automatically, or allow you to upload a thumbnail of your own choosing to be displayed in the center. Dominant colors from the artwork or thumbnail will then be used to give the player a unique look.

Whereas previously video thumbnails were automatically taken from the first frame of the video, you now also have the ability to **upload a custom thumbnail that will be displayed before the video starts playing**. Simply click on "Edit" on a newly uploaded media file and then choose a new thumbnail!

When you share links to video or audio on Mastodon on other platforms, for example Twitter, your friends will be able to **open Mastodon's video or audio player right on that platform** (assuming the platform supports the `twitter:player` tag).

To better protect your accounts when you're not there, there's a **new security mechanism guarding new login attempts**. When you don't have two-factor authentication setup, have been away for at least two weeks, and someone tries to login to your account from a previously unseen IP address, they will be required to enter a token sent to your e-mail address.

It's a feature more meant to guard those who forget to setup two-factor authentication, so if you are reading this, remember that it's good practice to use two-factor authentication (Mastodon's does not require a phone number or a Mastodon app, any TOTP app works), and to use a password manager to generate random and unique passwords for each account you have!

Have you ever blocked or muted someone but forgot why? Or have you followed someone but then forgot who they are? Now you can add **personal notes** to other accounts to keep track of who's who. Visible only to you!
