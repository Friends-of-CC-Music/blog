At the beginning of February, our team attended our very first conference at FOSDEM in Brussels. As a remote-only company, it was also the first time a lot of us met each other in real life. It was a very fun time, and a lot of people came up to take selfies in front of our company roll-up, buy our mugs, and tell us what they'd like to see in Mastodon. One thing became obvious: Sharing Mastodon handles in a loud hallway with a dozen conversations happening around you at all times is way too difficult. Wouldn't it be nice if you could just scan a QR code on the other person's phone? Well, this is what we've launched in our most recent [Mastodon for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.joinmastodon.android) release!

Simply navigate to your profile (or anyone's profile, actually) and click on the QR code icon next to the name to bring up a QR code that will allow others to open the profile on their device. There is quick access to a QR code scanner from that screen too. Scanning the code from our app will always open the profile in the app.

We want to make Mastodon as intuitive as possible, and a part of that is making sure you don't need to read documentation to understand what the different functions in the app do. We've updated the design of profiles to solve a common question that newer users tend to have, which is "what does the domain name in a Mastodon handle mean?". You can now tap the domain on a profile to bring up an information sheet that explains that decentralized nature of Mastodon.

In a similar vein, we've updated confirmation dialogs for all muting and blocking functions to explain what effects each action will have and what behaviours you can expect from the app as a consequence.
