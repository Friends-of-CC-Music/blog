The 2023 Annual Report is here, and we’re thrilled to share it with you under the theme of *“Growing Up”*. While its release comes later than we had originally planned, 2023 has been a whirlwind for Mastodon.

As a non-profit fueled entirely by donations, we believe in giving back to our community by offering a transparent look at our milestones and achievements over the past year.

As you dive into this report, remember that Mastodon is continuously evolving. Our 2024 review is already shaping up to shine a light on the the exciting next steps we’re making. We’re filled with optimism and excitement for what’s ahead.
