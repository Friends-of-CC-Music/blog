If you're curious how Mastodon is doing by the numbers, the 2023 Annual Report is finally here. A bit late in the year, perhaps, but we've got a lot more numbers to share this time! Mastodon is a non-profit, and open-source, so we revel in the transparency.

How large is our budget, and where does it go? Who works on Mastodon? What have we accomplished, and where are our priorities for the future? For all of this and more, we've got an answer--at least as far as 2023 goes.

We have already started work on the 2024 one, though!

Thank you to [**Pierre Vincent**](https://hellopierre.fr/) for designing our annual report and to [**Dopatwo**](https://www.youtube.com/dopatwo) for such a quick turnaround on new illustrations, and thank you to the team, especially Inga and Philip, for headlining the efforts to put this together.
